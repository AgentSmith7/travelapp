#### This is to understand buyer, for better match making

There are two parts of a buyer, knowing everything is not mandatory but will be useful
  
  (a) know him by his interest - this is a one time process, unless buyer interest changes with time
	:: in general, what he likes and what he dislikes --> his interests and popular themes
	:: how frequent he make trips
	:: where have he been so far
	:: normally with whom he makes trip
	:: normally how much he spend in his trip

  (b) know his INDIVIDUAL trip details - this is a continous process, every time when buyer wants to make a trip, we should know the following
	:: time, duration, budget, what is the theme of his trip, other travelers, etc

	^^ very important ^^ give top 3/5 questions that you would ask the seller - this will be used for match making


#### Main thing is: interest and themes... To know his interest, we can ask him
	locations previously visited, and average time spend in each
	float few common attraction types INTERSECTION with the ones he previously visited
	float questions like
		do u like road trips?
		what do u like eating?
		how much time u spend in pubs?
		interested in history or concerts or sports
		etc etc
