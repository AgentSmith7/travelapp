TERMINOLOGY USED IN THE DOCUMENT
buyers :: travelers
sellers :: consultant
## :: input taken from the user
$$ :: output given to the user
%% :: our back end calculation

Our hypothesis is that the entry point to a seller is location, so if a buyer doesnt know which location he wants to visit, we have to help him.

Buyers are mainly of 3 types
(a) knows what location / locations they want to visit
(b) do not know what locations they want to visit
(c) knows 1 location but want to explore other locations nearby for the same trip



case a: since buyer knows exactly, no suggestions required


case b: Buyer doesnt know location(s) to visit.. Then we ask:
	## current location
	## when/what time of the year the trip is for
	## how many days
	## interests - TODO 1 - how to ask the interest ?
	
	%% create first set of suggestion - TODO 2 - how to find suggestions ?
	(find suggestions along with reasons why we think they are good suggestions)
	$$ output first set of suggestion, along with location, attractions, high level price, interest matching, distance
	(suggestions should be interactive)
	(TODO 3 - how to find high level price ?) 
	## buyer can say "interested", "not interested", "may be"

	%% create more suggestions based on user feedback - TODO 4 - how to incorporate feedback to create new suggestion ?
	$$ output new suggestion list and repeat the process few times until buyer knows the location

	version 2: 
	## budget - will include this in version 2


case c: Buyer have already decided on 1 location, suggest him others. Then we ask:
	## do you need more suggestions	
	if the answer is "yes", the process is same as case b, just that the suggestion list will be
	first, close to location 1 that buyer has already decided
	second, complements user's interest + location 1 


TODOs:
(1) how to ask the interest ?
(2) how to find suggestions ?
(3) how to find high level price of the suggestions?
(4) how to incorporate feedback to create new suggestion ?
